#Git and SourceTree


##What is Git?

Git is a distributed version source control system. It enables fast file access and generally becomes your best friend rather quickly. This is especially true when prototyping new features or fixing bugs. Branching, merging, pulling, and pushing are frequently used to describe a git work flow. There are many types of work flows that you may encounter. Choosing a common work flow for the team is an important decision. Refer to the [Git](https://git-scm.com/documentation) documentation for more details.

##What is SourceTree?

[SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) happens to be a complimentary tool for Git. It provides a GUI for common Git commands and helps visualize branches.
