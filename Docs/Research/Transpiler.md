#Transpiler

##Why use a transpiler?

A transpiler transforms source code wherein the translated source code may enable extended functionality which is not available. Normally, transpilers convert the source code into a language with the same level of abstraction. [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) are two examples of languages which transpile into JavaScript. There are also transpilers for transforming [EcmaScript 6](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) into EcmaScript 5 compatible code.

#TypeScript

TypeScript provides three things I have always missed in JavaScript... Easy to use types, classes, and most importantly interfaces. EcmaScript 6 does have some overlapping features.

#EcmaScript 6

There are quite a few features in ES6 which are not available in all browsers today. I plan on taking advantage of the well known transpiler [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). Google also has a transpiler, [Traceur](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler), which enables a similar set of features.
