#Pointer Events Pollyfill

Gathering and interpreting user input is a fundamental piece in software development. Traditional desktop web applications use click events. In more recent years, there has been a burst in mobile and tablet touch enabled devices. In order to build a cross-browser and cross-platform web application, a development team would have to roll their own component to handle user input. Due to the growing number of input devices, Microsoft proposed a specification for generic [Pointer Events](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/) in September of 2012. Community driven pollyfills such as [HandJS](https://github.com/deltakosh/handjs) where created to fill the gap in browsers until the specification is fully implemented by all browsers. HandJS was later deprecated in favor of JQuery's [Pointer Event Pollyfill](https://github.com/jquery/PEP).
